- 👋 Hi, I’m @dhruvathejas
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning IoT and AI using block-based coding. I'm also learning HTML and CSS for web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something interesting.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I am still a kid. Probably, you may want to reach out to my parents.
- 😄 Pronouns: He, his, him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that banana is a berry? Now, what I don't understand is... If a banana is a berry, why is it not called a banberry?
